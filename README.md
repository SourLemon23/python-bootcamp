# Youth In Code Free 3-Week Python Bootcamp

This program is brought to you by [Youth In Code (YIC)](https://www.youthincode.cf/). YIC is a fiscally sponsored 501(c)(3) NPO by the Hack Foundation and Hack Club Bank that strives to connect students internationally online, giving them the opportunity to code projects by collaborating and communicating with their peers. YIC has partnered with several organizations in the past, impacted 10,000+ kids from 15 countries, and is only growing from there!

Aside from including 6 engaging workshops with live coding demos, this Python bootcamp employs project-based learning, where students get the opportunity to be hands-on by applying their knowledge in various labs. Moreover, the final workshop serves as a culmination of the tools accumulated throughout the 3 weeks, where students have the opportunity to create a Python project of socioeconomic value.
